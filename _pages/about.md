<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the [Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/australian-artificial-intelligence-institute), within the [Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT)](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia. I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Pro.f Shiping Wen](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Shiping.Wen) and [Dr. Feng Liu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Feng.Liu). Prior to my doctoral studies at UTS, I completed my M.S. degree at Tiangong University (Tianjin, China) under the supervision of [Prof. Jinliang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7NfLSq0AAAAJ) and my B.S. degree at Hebei University of Architecture (Zhangjiakou, Hebei, China). 

My research interest includes control theory and machine learning. The major topic of my research is safe control, Gaussian processes, and adaptive control. My work focues on safe control and learning for dynamical systems, including safe control design, system modeling, and the applications in vehicle platooning system and robotics. Currently, I am focusing on control barrier function method and Gaussian processes. Throughout my academic career, I have published more than 16 SCI papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at IEEE Transactions such as TCYB, TNSE, and TNNLs.
